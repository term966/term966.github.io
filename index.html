        <p>So pretty much finnished the course and it's fair to say the experience has been completley different to how I expected. I would liken it to thinking you'll be taught how to bricklay and expecting you can build a house. Instead it's like being taught how to lay foundations and then going away to learn how to build on that knowledge.</p>
        <P>Spoke to one of the other guys on the course at lunch who said it takes 25 hours of study before you can start to self correct so I need to start putting in serious time into building websites over and over again untill I can start to build on these foundations</P>

        <p>Been a more challenging class today but as with everything i've learnt I think it will just take time and practice to get the hang of</p>
        <p>I looked into adding a login section but that's going to require PHP and JS to do so I'll put that on hold untill I've really got the hang of HTML and CSS - Hopefully I can do a JS course at LAIT</p>

        <div class="post-content">
        <p>Sat in class learning the box model and creating a layout with float. Managed to take a lot of notes. Seem to be struggling with padding/margin etc for placing boxes arround the page. Might take a bit of experimentation tonight</p>
        <p>Probably going to be spending a lot of time on W3 tonight trying a few new things but I think i'll look at signing up for the immersive web design course as this dosen't cover JS or PHP</p>

        <p>So much for calling it a day....Really getting into this and started thinking what i want to experiment with next. As I ultimatley want to be able to develop a web application I think tomorrow I'll attempt to add a login section. If that goes well I'll try to add in a text entry field to post blog entires direct from the site however that may have to wait till thursday.</p>
        <p>Class finnishes at 3 tomorrow and I'm due to meet Michael at 5.30 so might just find a coffee shop somewhere and work there. Anyway time to try get some sleep</p>

        <h3 class="post-title">CTO Tom to the rescue!!</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
        <p> So turns out I didn't have to wait untill tomorrow to fix my nth-child issue. one of my colleagues from work took a look at the site and found the issue *very quickly i'm sure lol*</p>
        <p> The issue was that I had tagged every post with a id=content tag and the :nth-child CSS command requires the elements to be siblings and mine were just stand alone posts which is why they were either all coloured or none were. The fix was simple and just required me to remove the id=content tag from all posts and just have it at the top of the content section and closed off at the end of the content section so it wraps arround all posts.<p/> <p>Thanks for the help Tom :) </p>

        <p> Finnished off the rest of the blog but now strugling to change the background colour of posts in an alternating manner.....</p>
        <p>this might be a trickier one..... </p>
        <p> UPDATE: So I've worked out that using .post-container:nth-child(even) dosen't work however if I change it to (odd) it colours every post. Need to find out how odd/even effects the posts</p>
